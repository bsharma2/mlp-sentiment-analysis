# Word Embeddings

We train a multilayer neural network with L1 and L2 regularization to classify movie reviews from the 50k IMDb review dataset that has been collected by Maas et. al.

Default parameters:

    * Learning Rate: lr     = 1e-3
    * Lambda 1 (L1): l1     = 1e-6
    * Lambda 2 (L2): l2     = 1e-6
    * Batch        : BATCH  = 1 (SGD)
    * Epochs       : NEPOCH = 1
